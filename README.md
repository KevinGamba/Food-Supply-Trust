# Project Name: Safe Food Chain

## Food-Supply-Trust
A blockchain-based system for verifying the authenticity and safety of food products from farm to table. 
This platform helps consumers avoid counterfeit or unsafe food by offering transparency on the source, production methods, and transportation of food products.

### Problem Statement:
Kenyans face risks from food adulteration and safety issues, such as chemically-treated avocados sold as ripe, posing health threats. 
There's a need to ensure that food products are authentic, safe, and meet quality standards.

### Approach:
Leverage blockchain to track the journey of food products from farm to consumer. Each step in the supply chain, from production to distribution,
will be recorded immutably on the Aptos blockchain, and consumers will be able to verify the safety and authenticity of products via a QR code.

### Vision:
To ensure food safety not only in Kenya but across global supply chains, giving consumers confidence in the quality and authenticity of the products they purchase.

### Technology Stack:

- Blockchain: Aptos blockchain

- AI: TensorFlow for AI-powered matching
  
- Smart Contracts: Aptos smart contracts
  
- Front-end: React
  
- Backend: Flask
  
- Database: PostgreSQL
  
- AI-based sensors to detect food authenticity and quality
